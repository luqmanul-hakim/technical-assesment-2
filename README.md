# Project Name
Multiplication Table Generator
## Overview
This Python script generates and prints a multiplication table with adjustable parameters. It defines two functions:

print_output_row(j, step):

Initializes an empty string.
Iterates over a range of i values (1 to 3).
Builds and prints a row of formatted multiplication expressions.
print_line_by_line(step):

Calls print_output_row(j, step) for each j in the range 1 to 9.
Prints multiple rows of multiplication expressions.
The main loop:

Iterates over a range of step values (0 to 2).
Calls print_line_by_line(step*3) to generate different sets of rows.
Prints a separator line after each set of rows.
## Setup and Installation

Step 1: Create a Virtual Environment
Navigate to your project directory in the terminal and create a virtual environment. Replace venv with the desired name for your virtual environment:

**python3 -m venv venv**

Step 2: Activate the Virtual Environment
Activate the virtual environment. The activation command depends on your operating system:

**. venv/bin/activate**

After activation, your terminal prompt should change to indicate that you are now working within the virtual environment.

Step 3: Run Your Script or Application
Now, you can run your script or application within the virtual environment. For example:

**python3 tablegen.py**

Step 4: Deactivate the Virtual Environment
When you're done working on your project, deactivate the virtual environment:

**deactivate**
